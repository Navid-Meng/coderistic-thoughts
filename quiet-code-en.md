# The Art of Quiet Code

In the relentless pursuit of "more"—more features, more speed, more abstraction—we have forgotten the intrinsic value of silence. In engineering, silence manifests as simplicity.

### The Weight of Abstraction
Every layer of abstraction we add is a promise we make to the future. Most of these promises are broken. We build complex systems to solve problems that might never exist, creating a burden for those who follow.

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

### Practicing Minimalist Engineering
1. **Kill the ego.** Don't write clever code; write clear code.
2. **Embrace constraints.** Constraints are not walls; they are the canvas.
3. **Value durability.** Will this code make sense when the hype cycles have passed?
