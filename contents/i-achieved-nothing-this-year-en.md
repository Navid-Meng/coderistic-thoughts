# You
Feel like you achieved nothing this year,,, compared to everyone else. 

### But You
Got through your hardest days.

### But You
Took even the smallest steps towards your goals

### But You
Made someone smile

### But You
Found joy in the little things

### But You
Learn to set boundaries

### But You
Been there for the people you care about

### But You
Grew in ways u didn't even notice

> "Sometimes progress doesn't look like success — it looks like survival, healing, and quiet strength" 

### Quiet but powerful

and that still counts
Enough. Always.
