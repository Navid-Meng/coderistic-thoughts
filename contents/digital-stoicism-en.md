# Digital Stoicism

The modern me and you developer lives in a state of perpetual emergency. A new framework every week, a security vulnerability every hour, a notification every minute. 

### Control the Inputs
We cannot control the speed of the industry, but we can control our reaction to it. Stoicism teaches us to distinguish between what is ours and what is not.

> "He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a man who is alive." — Seneca

### The Machine vs The Soul
The machine wants your attention. The soul wants your presence. Choose presence.
